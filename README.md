# FlexiSAF-week2
# ML Internship Project â€” FlexiSAF Internship Programme

This project showcases my understanding of two machine learning techniques: **Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Ensemble Learning using Random Forests with Hyperparameter Tuning**. Each model is implemented on a different dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab.

## ðŸ§  Part 1: Deep Learning (CNN on Fashion-MNIST)

### âœ… Dataset:
- **Fashion-MNIST**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
- Contains 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories.

### ðŸ§© Model Summary:
- **Conv2D layers** to extract spatial features.
- **MaxPooling2D** to reduce dimensionality while retaining key features.
- **Dense (Fully Connected)** layers for classification.
- **Softmax activation** to output class probabilities.
- Trained using **categorical crossentropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.

### ðŸ§ª Evaluation:
- Plotted images with true labels.
- Tracked performance using accuracy.
- Saved and reloaded the model using the  `.h5` format.
- Demonstrated label prediction and model accuracy through comparison of actual vs predicted values.

## ðŸŒ² Part 2: Ensemble Learning (Random Forest on Loan Prediction Dataset)

### âœ… Dataset:
- Kaggle's [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) .
- Features include applicant income, gender, property area,  etc.

### ðŸ§© Model Summary:
- Used **RandomForestClassifier** with `class_weight='balanced'` to handle class imbalance.
- Employed **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning:
  - Tested different values for `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and more.
  - 4-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- Defined a custom scoring function (`my_accuracy_score`) to evaluate model accuracy.

### ðŸ§ª Evaluation:
- Handled missing values and categorical features.
- Compared training and validation accuracy.
- Analyzed feature importance (optional addition).
- Displayed classification metrics (confusion matrix, precision, recall).
